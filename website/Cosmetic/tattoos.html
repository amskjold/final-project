      <h1>Tatoos </h1>
      <p>Tatoos were not the common entity that they are today. For someone to have tattoos would be seen as a &quot;savage&quot; and &quot;uncivilized&quot; because tatoos had not yet caught on in Western countries. </p>
      <p>George Conteteus, one of the first tatooed freaks, has an interested story beind his signature tatoos. </p>
      <p>George Contentenus, America&rsquo;s &ldquo;first tattooed side act,&rdquo; was so committed to his stage story that little is known today about his actual origins. Born in 1836, he claimed to be a Greek-Albanian prince raised in a Turkish harem. </p>
      <p>His 338 tattoos covered nearly every inch of his body (save for his nose and the soles of his feet), were incredibly ornate, and depicted Burmese-specific species, and symbols from Eastern Mythology: snakes, elephants, storks, gazelles, dragons, plants, and flowers of all sorts intermingled on his skin. </p>
      <p>According to Contentenus&rsquo;s tale, he&rsquo;d been on a military expedition in Burma when he and three others were captured by &ldquo;savage natives&rdquo; and offered a choice: they could either be cut into pieces from toe to head, or receive full-body tattoos and be liberated -- should they survive the excruciating process. The soldiers chose the latter option, a process which took three months and killed Contentenus&rsquo;s accomplices.</p>
      <p>To convince the world that his story was true, he even went so far as to publish a 23-page book in 1881, documenting every detail of his alleged experience. It wasn&rsquo;t until much later in his career that Contentenus admitted he had feigned this tale in the hopes of attaining fame and fortune. And that he did.</p>
