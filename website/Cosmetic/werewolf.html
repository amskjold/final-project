      <h1>Werewolf Man</h1>
      <p>Born with a hair-covered face in 1873, Fedor was destined to follow in his father&rsquo;s footsteps. Adrian Jeftichew, known throughout Europe as &ldquo;The Siberian Dog-Man,&rdquo; was highly superstitious and believed that both he and Fedor were on the receiving end of divine punishment.</p>
      <p>Following his father&rsquo;s early death, the 16-year old Fedor became a ward of the Russian government. By this time,  he was&ldquo;covered with long, silky, fur-like hair that grew thickest on his face.&rdquo; While the public perceived him to be animal-like and savage, he was contrarily inquisitive, soft spoken, and shy.</p>
      <p>Fedor was adopted by a cold-hearted showman, brought to England, and advertised as &ldquo;the boy who was raised by wolves in Siberian wilderness.&rdquo; The ever-enterprising P.T. Barnum saw the act, purchased the boy&rsquo;s contract, and transitioned him to the United States in 1884. But, as with any of his performers, Barnum needed to embellish Fedor&rsquo;s story.</p>
      <p>The child became &ldquo;Jo-Jo The Dog-Faced Boy,&rdquo; and played the stereotype of the Victorian naturalist&rsquo;s approximation of a prehistoric man: he&rsquo;d been found in a cave deep in the forests of central Russia, feeding on berries and hunting with a rudimentary club; after enduring a bloody battle to capture the &ldquo;beast,&rdquo; hunters taught him to walk upright, wear clothes, and speak like a dignified human.</p>
      <p>Barnum dressed Fedor in a Russian cavalry uniform, and had him play up his savage nature, &ldquo;barking, growling, and baring his teeth&rdquo; at onlookers. Throughout the 1880s, Fedor was among the highest paid performers in the business, netting $500 per week ($13,000 today). By the time of his retirement, his saving totalled nearly $300,000 ($7.6 million).</p>
