      <h1>Two Faces </h1>
      <p>Freak shows have had a variet of deformities were people posesss two faces - either from an accident or a birth defomity.</p>
      <p>Amongst these people, Edward Mordake is a highly studied and regarded freak, but with a myser</p>
      <p>The story always begins the same way. Edward Mordake is said be have been heir to one of the noblest families in England.He was considered a bright and charming man – a scholar, a musician and a young man in possession of profound grace. He was said to be quite handsome when viewed from the front – yet, on the back of his head there was a second face, twisted and evil.</p>
      <p>In some versions of the story, the second face of Edward Mordrake is a beautiful girl.This is an impossibility as all parasitic twins are of the same sex. Often it was said that it possessed its own intelligence and was quite <span id="IL_AD1">malignant</span> in its intentions.It has been said that the eyes would follow spectators and its lips would &lsquo;gibber&rsquo; relentlessly and silently. According to legend it would smile and sneer as Edward Mordrake wept over his condition.While no voice was ever audible, Edward Mordrake swore that often he would be kept awake by the hateful whispers of his &lsquo;evil twin&rsquo;.</p>
      <p>The story has always concluded with young Edward Mordrake committing suicide at the age of twenty-three.The method of his death also differs, sometimes poison does him in and in other versions a bullet &lsquo;between the eyes of his devil-twin&rsquo; puts him out of his misery. In both versions Edward Morkdrake leaves behind a letter requesting that the &lsquo;demon face&rsquo; be destroyed before his burial, &lsquo;lest it continues its dreadful whisperings in my grave.&rsquo;</p>
